Optimize your site with Easy Equal Height Columns. Sync heights, manage containers, and customize CSS for design harmony

== Description ==

The Easy Equal Height Columns plugin is a simple yet powerful tool designed to enhance the appearance and functionality of your website by ensuring that columns within a section have equal height, regardless of their content. This is particularly useful in responsive designs where column heights can vary due to content differences, leading to a disjointed appearance.

Key Features:
- **Automatic Height Adjustment**: Automatically adjusts the height of columns within a container to match the tallest column, ensuring a clean and uniform appearance.
- **Customizable Containers and Items**: Easily specify which containers and their respective items should have equal heights, providing flexibility and control over your layout.
- **Responsive Design Friendly**: Works seamlessly with responsive designs, ensuring columns maintain equal height across different screen sizes.
- **No Coding Required**: Simple interface allows you to add, manage, and customize settings without writing a single line of code.

Whether you're running a blog, an e-commerce site, or a business website, Easy Equal Height Columns can help you achieve a polished and professional look.
